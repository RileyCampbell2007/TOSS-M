# TOSS-M
<sub><sup>*The Open Source System of Morality*</sub></sup>

## What Is TOSS-M?
**TOSS-M** aims to create a framework of rules for people to live by. Some of these rules can boil down to the golden rule, do unto others as you would have done unto you.

## What Are These Rules I Should Be Following?

*Any items marked with ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png) take precedence over rules that are not marked*

1. Do not physically or emotionally harm other people. If you or other people are in imminent danger of being harmed by someone you may cause the appropriate amount of harm to them required to ensure your safety. If someone consents to being physically harmed it may only be done if it does not sacrifice their mental health. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

2. Do not harm animals for entertainment, only kill an animal if the death would be relatively painless, and it is for the purpose of using it's materials or to spare them from more pain. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)
