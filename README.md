## What Is TOSS-M?
**TOSS-M** aims to create a set of rules for people to live by. Some of these rules can boil down to the golden rule, do unto others as you would have done unto you.

## What Are These Rules I Should Be Following?

*Any items marked with ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png) take precedence over rules that are not marked*

1. Do not physically or emotionally harm other people. If someone consents to being physically harmed it may only be done if it does not sacrifice their mental health. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

2. Do not harm animals for entertainment, only kill an animal if the death would be relatively painless, it is for the purpose of using it's materials, or to spare them from more pain. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

3. Prioritize your own mental and physical health before other people's. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

4. Do not compromise a person's autonomy unless they would be a harm to society, however it must not exempt them from other rules. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

5. The only sources to be used when evaluating someone's mental health is the person themselves or someone with proper certifications for evaluating mental health.

6. Do not share information relating to someone to another person unless the first person consents to you sharing that information.

7. Strive to assist others and provide services for others, whether it is for payment or not, however all parties involved must consent.
