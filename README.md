## What Is TOSS-M?
**TOSS-M** aims to create a set of rules for people to live by.

## What Are These Rules I Should Be Following?

*Any items marked with ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png) take precedence over rules that are not marked*

1. Do not physically or emotionally harm other people. If someone consents to being physically harmed it may only be done if it does not sacrifice their mental health. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

2. Do not harm animals for entertainment, only kill an animal if it is for the purpose of using it's materials or to spare them from more pain. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)

3. Prioritize your own mental and physical health before other people's. ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/5x5/f03c15/f03c15.png)
